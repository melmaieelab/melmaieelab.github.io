                        <p>Hi! My name is Lauren Waller and I’m currently a senior in the undergraduate program at Delaware State University and majoring in plant science. I joined the Plant Molecular Breeding Lab in 2023 to assist in the Dr. Melmaiee’s USDA-NIFA funded research programs.  My research focuses on exploring exotic vegetable options for small scale farmers and gardeners in Delaware, aiming to expand crop diversity and market opportunities. I have experience in horticulture, greenhouse management, and dendrology and I have done my internship at Winterthur Garden and Museum. I am very passionate about plant molecular breeding, sustainable agriculture, and the conservation of plant biodiversity and I am dedicated to developing innovative solutions for global food security. As an active member of MANRRS, the Environmental Alliance, and Lions Club, I strive to bridge the gap between scientific research and community outreach. In the long term, I aim to contribute to the development of climate-resilient crop varieties and work on breeding programs that support both small-scale farmers and large agricultural industries in adapting to changing environmental conditions.

                        <p>Greetings, my name is Byron Manzanero, a Master's candidate at Delaware State University. I work in the Molecular Plant Breeding lab under the supervision of Dr. Kalpalatha Melmaiee. My research encompasses the initial stage of molecular plant breeding which is the identification of potential breeding stock with genes in interest. To be specific, my project focuses on the evaluation of genetic diversity of a wild blueberry population with the use of SNP's (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and next generation sequemcing. The project results will hopefully help create new blueberry varieties that are more productive and resistant to the everchanging environment allowing the industry to continue growing and prospering </p>

                        <p>I am graduate student in Plant Molecular Breeding lab. I am studying the effects of potassium-silicate foliar spray on strawberry plants grown in a high tunnel environment.  Silicate is the second most abundant mineral in soil and some plant species can absorb it through their root system using silicate transporters.  Silicon accumulates in plant cell walls in the form of phytoliths, thin sheet like structures that will prevent pest and diseases from penetrating plant cuticles.  In addition, silicon treated plants demonstrate a greater ability to withstand abiotic and biotic stresses.</p>
